# Micro820-Stop-lights
I'm learning to program an Allen Bradley Micro820 with Connected Components Workbench

I have an Allen Bradley Micro820 trainer connected to four digital inputs, four digital outputs, one analog input, and one analog output

Since I'm not entirely sure which files I need to upload for people to be able to open the program, and since the program is super simple, I'll just upload a picture of the ladder logic.
